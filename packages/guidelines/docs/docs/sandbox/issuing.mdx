# Issuing

These steps will show you how to use the issuer side of the sandbox.

## Issue A VC

Before you issue a VC you need to create the data that will go inside it.

### Steps

1. Go to [sandbox.bloom.co/issue](https://sandbox.bloom.co/issue)
2. Name the credential type ("CustomCredential","EmailCredential", etc.)
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sandbox/issuing/enter-type.png')} alt="Enter VC type" />
3. Enter the data you want to issue, it must be valid data defined by the [VC Data](https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/vc-network-update/dev/packages/vc-data/src/data) library
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sandbox/issuing/add-data.png')} alt="Add data" />

```js
// Sample email VC Data
{
  '@type': 'Person'
  email: 'testing@gmail.com'
}
```

3. Click the button that says "Issue VC"

## Claim A VC

After creating a VC to issue you can claim it, here you are acting as an end user that is being offered a credential. This is as simple as scanning a QR code or clicking a button.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the link sent in response to the VC creation
2. Click the button that says "Claim With Local DID" if using the local client, otherwise use the Bloom app to scan the QR code
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sandbox/issuing/claim.png')} alt="Claim options" />
3. You will now have the VC stored in your wallet!
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sandbox/issuing/claim-success.png')} alt="Successful credential claim" />

### Tech Details

Let's see what happens when you claim a VC

1. The user's client [sends their DID](https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/blob/vc-network-update/dev/sandbox/client/src/components/LocalClientProvider/index.tsx#L161) to the given URL in the QR code
2. The issuer takes the user's DID and [finishes building](https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/blob/vc-network-update/dev/sandbox/server/src/routes/cred.ts#L143) the VC including signing it
3. The issuer [sends the signed VC](https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/blob/vc-network-update/dev/sandbox/server/src/routes/cred.ts#L178) back to the user's client
4. (_Coming Soon_) The user's client verifies the VC and stores it to be shared at a later date
