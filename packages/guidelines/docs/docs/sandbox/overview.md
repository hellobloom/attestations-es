# Overview

The [VC Sandbox](https://sandbox.bloom.co) shows the flow of credentials from the issuer to the holder and then from the holder to the verifier or relying party. For better experiance the sandbox comes with a local client that can store and share credentials.

## Issuing

The issuance flow take you through the process to create a VC and issue it to an end user.

## Verifying

The verification flow walks you through the steps of requesting a VC from an end user and verifying the authenticity of signatures.
